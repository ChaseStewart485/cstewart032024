# Post Lab Notes
## mL vs. cm^3 LAB


* looking for a strong linear pattern 
* y=mx+b


### Example 
    2.78g/ml*volume(ml)=0.40


The Mass Volume Relationship is based on the slope of a point ( Object that is being measured )

    slope 
        rise(y)      mass      g
        -------  =  ------- = ---
        run(x)      volume    ml 


### Data

    AL ( Aluminum ) = 29.71g(0.05) =  1.5 
    Cu ( Copper )   = 69.50g(0.05) = 3.5

        Mass: The measure of matter in (g)
        Volume: The space an object take up (cc, ml)

### Defintion
    g/ml  =  /  =  "per" 
    Grams of mass per everyone ml of Volume
