        <h3>John P. Mello Jr.</h3>
        <p>A new report from Forrester Research emphasizes the importance of organizations preparing for quantum security threats, even though quantum computers that can break current encryption may not be available for 5 to 10 years. The report warns that hackers are already using a “harvest now, decrypt later” approach, where they store encrypted data today and wait for quantum computers to break the encryption in the future.</p>

        <p>Experts suggest that organizations need to start planning for this now because the transition to quantum-safe encryption will take time and rely on third-party upgrades. While quantum computing won’t be an immediate threat, industries with sensitive data, like governments and banks, are already taking action.</p>

        <p>Some experts recommend understanding where encrypted data is stored and how it’s protected, while others advise focusing on current security vulnerabilities. A flexible approach to cryptography, called "crypto-agility," will allow organizations to adapt to new security algorithms as quantum computing advances.</p>

        <p>The report stresses the need to act now to avoid future risks, as quantum computing could pose a trillion-dollar threat if organizations aren’t prepared.</p>
