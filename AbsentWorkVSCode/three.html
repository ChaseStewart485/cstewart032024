        <h3>John P. Mello Jr.</h3>
        <p>The article discusses how Low Earth Orbit (LEO) networks, like Elon Musk’s Starlink, are challenging traditional Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) networks. GEO satellites, once dominant in communications, are now struggling to compete as LEO satellites offer lower latency, more frequent updates, and global coverage. LEO networks can support applications like gaming and video calling, which GEO satellites struggle with due to higher latency.</p>

        <p>However, GEO satellites still have advantages like broader coverage, fewer issues with space debris, and the ability to handle more data. GEO networks are also less costly to maintain than LEO networks. Experts suggest that while GEO will still play a role in applications like IoT, LEO networks are better for high-speed, low-latency services. Some companies, like Eutelsat, see a multi-orbit approach—using both GEO and LEO— as the future of satellite communication.</p>

        <p>Despite the rise of LEO, GEO networks will likely continue to be used for specific applications like broadcasting, government communications, and Earth observation. However, GEO operators may need to adapt by focusing on these areas and shifting away from retail broadband, where LEO networks have an advantage.</p>
