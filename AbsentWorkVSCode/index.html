            Welcome to my little corner of the internet! You're about to dive into a page built with determination, creativity, and—believe it or not—one arm. That's right, I created this entire website while recovering from surgery, which left me temporarily minus one functioning limb. But hey, necessity is the mother of invention, right? And if you’ve ever tried typing with one hand, you know that what seemed like a simple task quickly turns into a mini marathon of awkwardness.
        
            It all started on a quiet Sunday morning. I’d just had surgery on my arm (don’t ask how—let's just say it involved an ill-advised attempt at karate moves that I definitely don’t remember, but my friends swear I was "totally impressive" in the moment). So, there I was, one arm in a sling, attempting to type with the grace of a clumsy octopus who’d never seen a keyboard before. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t pretty.
        
            Instead of sulking in frustration, I decided to turn this setback into a challenge. I Googled “how to create a website with one hand,” only to discover that there were approximately zero results on that topic. So, I did what any logical person would do—ignored the lack of expertise and just dove in. Sure, my mouse had a temporary relationship with my lap, and my keyboard saw more of my forehead than it should have, but that didn’t stop me. There were moments when I may have accidentally created an entire page of gibberish or embedded a photo of a rubber chicken where a button should go. But every mistake was a learning opportunity.
        
            And, well, after a few weeks of one-arm web wizardry, here we are! From the humble beginnings of a squinty-eyed, one-armed typing session to the polished site you’re visiting today, I learned a lot—mainly that I never want to write code with one hand again. But hey, the site’s up, and it’s proof that no matter what life throws at you (even if it’s a poorly-timed surgery), you can still find a way to make something cool. Thanks for visiting and enjoy! ~ <strong>Chat GPT</strong></p>
