        <h3>John P. Mello Jr.</h3>
        <p>Americans spend an average of six hours and 40 minutes a day on screens, which is slightly above the global average. Experts have mixed opinions on whether this amount of screen time is too much. Some believe it's excessive, especially when it comes to mobile screen time, which is often not work-related. Others argue that screen time depends on the individual, their job, and whether it affects other aspects of life, like sleep or relationships.</p>

        <p>The survey also found that Americans spend about two hours a day on social media, with YouTube being the most popular platform. The study shows that people in developing regions, such as Africa and Asia, tend to spend even more time on screens, especially because smartphones are often the main way they access the internet.</p>

        <p>However, in many countries, screen time has decreased slightly compared to last year, likely due to post-pandemic changes and growing awareness of the negative effects of too much screen use. Some countries have even introduced rules to limit screen time for children, although enforcement is difficult. Technology companies are also offering features that help users manage their screen time and take breaks.</p>
