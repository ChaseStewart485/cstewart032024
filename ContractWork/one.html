        <h3>John P. Mello Jr.</h3>
        <p>The article discusses a recent ISC2 survey showing that more women are entering cybersecurity from non-IT or military backgrounds, with 37% of women in the field coming from these areas. It also found that women are more likely than men to use education, professional development, and apprenticeships to advance their careers. Additionally, 56% of women said their companies are changing hiring requirements to include people from non-cybersecurity backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Experts suggest that women bring valuable problem-solving skills and diverse perspectives to cybersecurity. However, they still face challenges, such as gender bias, unequal pay, and fewer leadership opportunities. Many women are pursuing advanced degrees and certifications to improve their qualifications, often waiting until they meet most of the job requirements before applying.</p>
        <p>The article also highlights the role of certifications in closing the cybersecurity skills gap, especially for those switching careers. While certifications can be important, many companies still prioritize a four-year degree, which can limit opportunities for candidates with strong skills but without formal degrees.</p>
        <p>Overall, while progress is being made, more needs to be done to create equal opportunities for women in cybersecurity.</p>
